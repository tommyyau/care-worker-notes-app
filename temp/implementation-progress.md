- [x] Initialize Git repository (ready for git init)

### âœ… 1.2 Storage & Environment Setup
- [x] Create LocalStorage utility functions
- [x] Set up environment variables for OpenAI API
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces for data models
- [x] Set up OpenAI client configuration

### âœ… 1.3 Data Models & Storage Schema
- [x] Define note data structure interfaces
- [x] Create LocalStorage management utilities
- [x] Implement data serialization/deserialization
- [x] Add sample data structure for testing

### âœ… 1.4 Core Components Created
- [x] AudioRecorder component with Web Audio API
- [x] TextEditor component for raw notes
- [x] EnhancementPanel component for professional output
- [x] TemplateSelector component for visit types
- [x] ApiKeyWarning component for setup guidance
- [x] Main App component with two-panel layout

### âœ… 1.5 Services & Integration
- [x] OpenAI service with Whisper and GPT-4o integration
- [x] Professional enhancement prompt implementation
- [x] Error handling and user feedback
- [x] API key validation

**Phase 1 Deliverables - COMPLETED**: 
- âœ… Working dev environment (http://localhost:5173)
- âœ… Complete project structure
- âœ… LocalStorage utilities implemented
- âœ… All core components functional
- âœ… Professional README documentation

## ðŸš€ Current Status: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Testing

### What's Working:
1. **Complete UI**: Two-panel layout with all components
2. **Audio Recording**: Web Audio API integration ready
3. **Text Editing**: Functional text editor with word/character count
4. **Template Selection**: Visit type selection working
5. **API Integration**: OpenAI services configured (needs API key)
6. **Local Storage**: Data persistence implemented
7. **Professional Enhancement**: GPT-4o prompt ready for testing

### Next Steps:
1. **Add OpenAI API Key**: User needs to configure `.env.local`
2. **Test Audio Recording**: Verify microphone permissions and recording
3. **Test Transcription**: Verify Whisper API integration
4. **Test Enhancement**: Verify GPT-4o note enhancement
5. **Test Data Persistence**: Verify LocalStorage functionality
